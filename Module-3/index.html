                Though the idli is today recognized as a south-Indian delicacy, it may have originated elsewhere. Many believe that the idli came to India between 800-1200CE from Indonesia where it is known as a kedli. Given the many links between south Indian rulers and Indonesian rulers, this is not very hard to believe.

Others believe that Arab traders introduced the Indian coasts to idlis. These Arab traders had strict dietary norms and hence instead of eating the local food which may not have been halaal, they ate flattened rice balls with a coconut paste.

There are a number of stories about the origins of the word ‘idli’ as well. Some historians believe that the word, idli, was derived from Iddalige, a word mentioned in the Vaddaradhane, a Kannada text by Sivakotyacharya in 920AD.

There are many who claim that it was derived from the word, Iddarika, a term mentioned in a 12th century Sanskrit text. There are some people who also claim that it was derived from a dish called Idada that was made by silk weavers from Saurashtra in 10AD. No matter where it came from and the process of making it is one that was perfected only in South-India.Though the idli is today recognized as a south-Indian delicacy, it may have originated elsewhere.
